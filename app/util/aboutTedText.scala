		In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring
		people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers
		combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx,
		where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the
		TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

		TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in
		California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual
		TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of
		these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane
		Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala,
		Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.
