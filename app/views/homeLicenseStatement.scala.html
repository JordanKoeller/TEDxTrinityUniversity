		In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has
		created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program
		of local, self-organized events that bring people
		together to share a TED-like experience. Our
		event is called TEDxTrinityUniversity, where x = independently
		organized TED event. At our TEDxTrinityUniversity event, TED
		Talks video and live speakers will combine to spark
		deep discussion and connection in a small group.
		The TED Conference provides general guidance for
		the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events,
	including ours, are self-organized.	</p>
